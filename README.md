# Banking-Management-

The Banking Management System is a Python-based application that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to simulate core banking operations, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform for managing basic banking activities. This project is designed to offer functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, checking account balances, and managing account information. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of OOP principles in organizing and implementing a banking management solution with a focus on code readability, scalability, and efficiency.

Features

Account Management: Create new accounts with unique account numbers and user details, ensuring organized data storage.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Allow users to deposit funds into their accounts and withdraw money while maintaining an updated balance.
Balance Inquiry: Check the current balance of an account with easy navigation and quick access.
Account Details Update: Edit or update account information such as the account holder's name, contact number, and address.
Transaction History: Maintain a record of all transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks for auditing and transparency.
Secure and Interactive Interface: User-friendly console-based interface with clear instructions and validations to ensure smooth user interactions.

Object-Oriented Concepts Used

Classes and Objects: Structured the code into classes representing different entities like Bank, Account, and Transaction to encapsulate data and related functionalities.
Encapsulation: Used to hide the internal implementation details and expose only the necessary functions, enhancing security and modularity.
Inheritance: Utilized to extend classes, allowing the addition of specific functionalities such as different account types (Savings, Current).
Polymorphism: Enabled operations like depositing and withdrawing funds to behave differently depending on the account type.
Data Abstraction: Abstracted complex functionalities into simplified methods for ease of use, such as create_account(), deposit(), withdraw(), and display_balance().
